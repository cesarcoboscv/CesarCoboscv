# ðŸ‘‹Hey

## I'm glad to see you  

I'm **CÃ©sar**.  and it's nice to see you here. Here you can find all proyects that I'm working on while I learn to code.

I have a degree in Civil Engineering and currently I'm deditated to Metallic Structures Design  and Project Management.

I decided to re-learn to progam to create solution to my area at work like:  
  
* *AutoLISP routines for AutoCAD:*  
* *Python*  
* *C*
* *HTML & CSS*

These are the languages that I'm learning currently, I haven't too much experience, but in these repo's is everything that I have made.
